# CJ gotta catch 'em all!

After years of coding, CJ decided to abandon everything and start following his dream: to become the best Pokemon trainer ever!

60 secs. This is all the time you have to click on moving Pokemons and name it correctly. If you success, CJ will catch this Pokemon. If you fail, no candy for you.

## What is your motivation for creating this project?

The best resume one can have is an online portfolio. I think this idea implemented with some flavouring will be fun and a nice personal accomplishment.

## How will users interact with your web site?

A grid of moving Pokemons. Click on one of them and be sure to type the correct name of it.

## What 3rd Party API(s) will you integrate with?

## Tech Stack

- Only plain css (actually sass).
- No 3rd party libraries, but only the necessary to compile Typescript.

## Will you try to implement any stretch features?

I have not decided yet on what to add. What is almost sure:

- Build process with webpack transpiling Typescript code.
- Use sass.
- CSS grid.
- A good documentation.
- A good project structure and organization.
- Tests with Jest.
- Mobile first (unless very specific cases, this is a must for every project nowadays).

What I may add:

- UI animation (will try without adding a lib).
- WebComponents (with Typescript!).
- PWA.
- SPA.
- OO approach.

## What will be your process?

Although motivated, I have to split my focus between this project, my work, family, other projects and a specialization. So I may not be able to finish it on 1.5 week.

Haven't decided which project management to use. Maybe GitHub Project.

For UX/UI I made some draws and notes, then plan to sketch up on HTML later.
